You are working in repository via-decide/VIA on branch main.

MISSION
Implement a core backend module called via-shadow-router to enable A/B testing and "shadow deployments" of new AI agent logic in production. 1. Create a new directory src/core/network/shadow-router/. 2. Create experiment-config.json defining active experiments, traffic allocation percentages (e.g., 5% to Variant B), and target agent IDs. 3. Implement ShadowRouter.js (or .ts). This module will sit alongside the PredictiveEngine. 4. Build the shadow logic: When a request comes in, the router must route the live request to the primary (Control) agent to ensure the user gets a fast, stable response. Simultaneously, it must asynchronously duplicate the request payload and send it to the experimental (Variant) agent. 5. Build a comparator function: Capture the output, execution time, and memory usage of *both* the Control and Variant agents. 6. Discard the Variant's response (do not send it to the user), but log the comparative metrics to the telemetry stream or database for developer analysis.

CONSTRAINTS
Do NOT block the main event loop or delay the Control agent's response to the user. The payload duplication and Variant execution must be strictly "fire-and-forget" from the main thread's perspective, offloaded entirely to the WorkerPool. Ensure that the Variant agent operates in a read-only or sandboxed database context so it cannot accidentally mutate real production user data during its test run.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
